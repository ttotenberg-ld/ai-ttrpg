# Product Requirements Document: AI-Powered TTRPG Adventure App

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an application designed to dynamically create and manage tailored Tabletop Role-Playing Game (TTRPG) style short adventures. The core experience involves a player interacting with an AI Game Master (GM) entirely through audio. The application will feature a Python backend and a React frontend.

## 2. Goals

*   To provide users with unique, dynamically generated TTRPG adventures.
*   To offer an immersive gameplay experience through AI-driven narration and audio interaction.
*   To allow players to create, manage, and develop persistent player characters (PCs).
*   To simplify the TTRPG experience by having an AI manage the complexities of GMing and content creation.

## 3. Target Audience

*   Individuals interested in TTRPGs but may not have a group to play with.
*   Players looking for a quick, accessible TTRPG experience.
*   Users interested in interactive storytelling and AI-driven content.

## 4. Definitions

*   **Player:** The human user who is interacting with the adventure.
*   **PC (Player Character):** The in-universe character that the player is controlling.
*   **Adventure:** The overarching story, with a clearly defined end goal.
*   **Encounter:** Smaller events which build toward the end goal of the adventure.
*   **GM (Game Master):** An AI who will be narrating the scenes and interacting with the player.
*   **Dice Roll / Skill Check:** A mechanic where the success or failure of a PC's attempted action is determined by a simulated roll of dice, often modified by the PC's relevant stats or skills. The GM determines when a check is needed and its difficulty.

## 5. Product Components & Features

### 5.1. Core Adventure Loop

*   **Dynamic Adventure Generation:** The system will generate a unique adventure with an overarching story, a clear end goal, and 1-3 encounters.
*   **AI Game Master:** An AI will:
    *   Narrate scenes and describe the environment.
    *   Voice non-player characters (NPCs).
    *   Respond to player actions and dialogue.
    *   Guide the player through the adventure and its encounters.
    *   Prompt for and interpret dice rolls for skill checks, attacks, and other challenged actions.
    *   Determine the outcome of actions based on dice rolls and PC capabilities.
*   **Encounters:**
    *   Varied in style (e.g., conversations, puzzles, escape rooms, battles).
    *   May require dice rolls (skill checks, attack rolls, saving throws) to overcome challenges or achieve objectives.
    *   Supported by AI-generated imagery depicting the encounter.
    *   Designed to lead progressively towards the adventure's end goal.
    *   Battles can be resolved through multiple approaches (strength, intelligence, charm).
*   **Reward System:** Upon completing an adventure, the PC receives a reward (e.g., equipment, new skill, upgraded abilities) to enhance their character.

### 5.2. Player Character (PC) Management

*   **Character Creation:** Players can create new PCs.
*   **Character Sheet:** Each PC will have a "character sheet" detailing:
    *   Stats (e.g., strength, dexterity, intelligence, charisma) – these will modify dice rolls.
    *   Personality traits.
    *   Skills – these may provide bonuses or enable specific actions related to dice rolls.
    *   Inventory/Equipment.
*   **Character Loading:** Players can load existing PCs for new adventures.
*   **Character Progression:** PCs are persistent and can be enhanced through adventure rewards.

### 5.3. Audio Interaction

*   **Voice Input:** The player interacts with the GM primarily or exclusively via audio.
*   **Voice Output:** The GM communicates with the player via synthesized speech.
*   **NPC Voices:** The GM AI should be capable of producing distinct voices for different NPCs.

### 5.4. User Interface (React Frontend)

*   **Home Screen:**
    *   Manage PCs (create, view, select).
    *   Initiate adventure generation.
*   **Adventure Interface:**
    *   Display AI-generated imagery for encounters.
    *   Provide a clear "Begin Adventure" call to action.
    *   Potentially display a transcript of the audio interaction (optional).
    *   Visually display dice roll results and their implications (e.g., "Success!", "Failure - 10 rolled / 12 needed") for player clarity (optional, but recommended).
    *   Interface for applying rewards/changes to the PC post-adventure.

## 6. Technical Components

*   **Backend:** Python-based.
*   **Frontend:** React-based.
*   **Adventure Coordination Module:**
    *   Collects PC information and player preferences.
    *   Constructs prompts/instructions for AI to generate the adventure and encounters.
*   **GM AI:**
    *   Processes audio input from the player.
    *   Generates narrative and dialogue responses.
    *   Manages game state and encounter progression.
    *   Initiates and resolves dice rolls, factoring in PC stats, skills, and situational modifiers.
    *   Integrates with adventure content and supporting media.
*   **Media Generation AIs:**
    *   AI for generating static imagery for encounters.
    *   AI for generating sound effects.
    *   AI for generating background music.
*   **Database:** To store user accounts, PC data, and potentially adventure logs.
*   **Authentication System:** For user login and security.

## 7. User Journey

1.  **Log In/Sign Up:** User accesses the application.
2.  **Character Management:**
    *   User creates a new character (defining stats, personality, etc.).
    *   Or, user loads an existing character.
3.  **Adventure Initiation:**
    *   User requests the system to generate an adventure tailored to the selected PC.
    *   User can potentially specify preferences for the adventure (e.g., theme, difficulty, length).
4.  **Adventure Start:**
    *   Once the adventure is generated, the user reviews a brief summary and clicks "Begin."
5.  **Gameplay:**
    *   The user interacts with the GM using only audio.
    *   The GM narrates, presents encounters, and responds to the player's speech.
    *   When the PC attempts an action with an uncertain outcome (e.g., attacking a foe, persuading a character, disarming a trap), the GM may call for a dice roll.
    *   The GM will state the type of roll needed (e.g., "Roll for persuasion," "Make an attack roll"). The system (or GM AI) simulates the roll.
    *   The outcome of the roll, modified by PC stats/skills, determines success or failure, which the GM narrates.
    *   Visuals (imagery) are displayed corresponding to current scenes/encounters.
    *   (If implemented) Dice roll results may be briefly displayed visually.
6.  **Adventure Completion:**
    *   The GM guides the user through the final encounter and conclusion of the adventure.
7.  **Reward & Progression:**
    *   The user is presented with a reward.
    *   The user can apply changes/upgrades to their PC's character sheet.
8.  **Post-Adventure:** User can choose to start a new adventure, manage characters, or log out.

## 8. Success Metrics (Suggested)

*   **User Engagement:**
    *   Daily Active Users (DAU) / Monthly Active Users (MAU).
    *   Average session length.
    *   Number of adventures completed per user.
*   **User Retention:**
    *   Cohort retention rates (e.g., percentage of users returning after 1 week, 1 month).
*   **Content Generation Quality:**
    *   User ratings for generated adventures/encounters (e.g., a 1-5 star rating system post-adventure).
    *   Frequency of users abandoning adventures mid-way.
*   **Technical Performance:**
    *   Latency of AI responses (GM and media generation).
    *   Application stability and error rates.

## 9. Future Considerations / Out of Scope for V1 (Suggested)

*   **Multiplayer:** Allowing multiple players to join the same adventure.
*   **Advanced Media:** AI-generated video or fully dynamic 3D environments instead of static images.
*   **Deeper NPC Interaction:** NPCs with more complex memories and relationships.
*   **Player-to-Player Interaction:** If multiplayer is added.
*   **Adventure Sharing:** Allowing users to share seeds or summaries of their favorite generated adventures.
*   **Advanced Character Customization:** More granular control over appearance, backstory, etc.
*   **Text-based Interaction Fallback:** For accessibility or preference.
*   **Saving/Loading Adventure Progress:** Allowing a player to pause an adventure and resume it later.
