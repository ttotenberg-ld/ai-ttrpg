# Task List Management

Guidelines for managing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing a PRD

## Task Preparation
- **Before starting a top-level task:**
  1. Check the top-level task's intention against the source PRD this task list was derived from
  2. Thoroughly audit the subtasks within this top-level task's group to ensure they coincide with with the PRD's requirements

## Task Implementation
- **Completion protocol:**  
  1. One sub-task at a time. You **MUST** process only one sub-task at a time. Do not work on a following **sub-task** until the prior **sub-task** is complete.
  2. When you finish a **sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.  
  3. If **all** subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, also mark the **parent task** as completed.

## Task Testing
- **When a top-level task is complete:**
  1. Thoroughly audit the implementation of the top-level task, and all subtasks to ensure they are functioning, and coincide with the intended implementation described by the source PRD.
  2. If necessary, create tests to validate the functionality of these tasks are working properly.

## Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the task list as you work:**
   - Mark tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above.
   - Add new tasks as they emerge.

2. **Maintain the “Relevant Files” section:**
   - List every file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one‑line description of its purpose.

## AI Instructions

When working with task lists, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the task list file after finishing any significant work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **sub‑task** `[x]`.
   - Mark the **parent task** `[x]` once **all** its subtasks are `[x]`.
3. Add newly discovered tasks.
4. Keep “Relevant Files” accurate and up to date.
5. Before starting work, check which sub‑task is next.
6. After implementing a sub‑task, update the file and then pause for user approval.
